            <h2>Tarkan Tevetoglu</h2>
            <p>Tarkan Tevetoğlu (Turkish pronunciation: [taɾˈkan teveˈtoːɫu]; born 17 October 1972) is a Turkish singer-songwriter. 
            Since the early 1990s, with the successful sales of his albums, he has been a prominent figure of the Turkish pop music, 
            being known in Turkey, Europe and Western Asia. Tarkan was born and raised in Alzey, Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1986, he moved 
            to Turkey together with his family. Tarkan, who had been interested in music since his childhood, went to high school at Karamürsel 
            and took music lessons. In the following years, he met the owner of İstanbul Plak, Mehmet Söğütoğlu, and signed a contract to release his own album.
            Tarkan released his first album Yine Sensiz in late 1992 with "Kıl Oldum" being chosen as its lead single. His second and third albums, 
            Aacayipsin and Ölürüm Sana, were released in 1994 and 1998 respectively. The song "Şımarık" from Ölürüm Sana became popular in a number 
            of countries. In 1998, he signed a new contract with Universal Music Group. In 1999, his compilation album, Tarkan, received platinum 
            and gold certifications in several countries. In 2001, he made music videos for the songs "Kuzu Kuzu, "Hüp" and "Verme" from his fourth 
            studio album Karma. Two years later, the album Dudu performed well on the sales charts, and in 2006 with the release of his first English 
            album, Come Closer, he became known in Europe. "Bounce" and "Start the Fire" were the lead singles of this album. The lyrics of the songs 
            included in the album Metamorfoz were praised by the Turkish Language Association. In 2010, his seventh studio album, Adımı Kalbine Yaz, 
            became the best-selling album of the year in Turkey. In 2016, his ninth studio album, Ahde Vefa, which has a Classical Turkish theme, was released.</p>
